<p class='wff-infobox-content'>WebFlipFlapp is an online tool for managing things that you store in boxes, and need your attention every now and then. It's powered by Google App Engine and uses Google Drive and Google Calendar as backends for managing all important information. It allows you to easily share the "databases" (spreadsheets) and "schedules" (calendars) with friends or colleagues or colleagues who are friends.</p>
